    "##### Stemming Words with NLTK:\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is the process of reducing a word to its word stem that affixes to suffixes and prefixes or to the roots of words known as a lemma. Stemming is important in natural language understanding (NLU) and natural language processing (NLP)\n",
    "Stemming is also a part of queries and Internet search engines\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also a preprocessing step\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word. Stemming programs are commonly referred to as stemming algorithms or stemmers. A stemming algorithm reduces the words “chocolates”, “chocolatey”, “choco” to the root word, “chocolate” and “retrieval”, “retrieved”, “retrieves” reduce to the stem “retrieve”.\n",
    "https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-stemming-words-with-nltk/\n",
    "\n",
    "In language, different variations of words and sentences often having the same meaning. Stemming is desirable as it may reduce redundancy as most of the time the word stem and their inflected/derived words mean the same\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To account for all the variations of words in the english language, we can use the Porter stemmer, which has been around since 1979.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recognizing, searching and retrieving more forms of words returns more results. When a form of a word is recognized it can make it possible to return search results that otherwise might have been missed. That additional information retrieved is why stemming is integral to search queries and information retrieval."
